# ImgSorterForSD

How To!
Press File and choose a folder that has images, for example ./stable-diffusion-webui/outputs
ImgSorter will look inside all subdirectories(so dont select any folder with too many images!)
for images and display the first, when you choose an option the image will move to either
./SortedImages/Keep, ./SortedImages/Maybe or ./SortedImages/Exclude
To send the current image to:
Keep, press 1 or numpad1,
Maybe, press 2 or numpad2,
Exclude press 3 or numpad3

If you make a mistake and want to go back, press 4 or numpad4

The program will remember the last selected project folder
